# Why Online Reputation Matters

Buyers need to trust sellers

* Product descriptions
* Fulfilling transactions 

Sellers need to trust buyers 

* Ensure buyer will pay
* Abide by terms of service

Where does this trust come from?

$\implies$ **reputation systems** 

... and design choices made by a marketplace

---
# What do we want to know?


... and much more

* But there's a fixed amount of time here

# Reputation & Price

Estimating Equation:

$$
price = \beta ( \text{reputation_measure} ) +
        \gamma( \text{other demand factors} ) +
        \text{error}
$$

Results

(Table 2)

# Negative Feedback & Sales Growth

Metric: Difference in Sales Growth before / after first negative feedback

(Table 3)

---
# Frequency of Negative Feedback

Metric: Frequency of Arrival of Negative Feedback

---
# Managerial Implications

1. Price / Willingess to Pay is not the main metric through which decreases in reputation operates
2. Quantity sold is an important metric
  * Sales decrease with negative feedback 
3. Negative Feedback can generate more negative feedback
  * Though authors argue this is moral hazard - less effort by sellers

# Managerial Response to Online Reviews

# Managerial Reviews & Reputation 

**Motivation**: Business increasingly proactive to managing reputation

**One Approach**: Managerial Responses

**Question**: What is the effectiveness of Managerial Responses on future reviews?

* Are there more or less? $\implies$ volume effects
* Are the more or less positive $\implies$ valence effects

Following discussion based on [Chen et al, 2019][chen-etal]

# Empirical Approach

**Data**: Travel Agencies in China (two): Ctrip & eLong

**Empirical Approach**: Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences

* This is an extension of the Difference in Differences idea we've seen before

* **What makes all this work**: Ctrip introduces managerial response, eLong does not

---
# Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences

Why an extra difference? Let's think intuitively...

* Assume only two periods, 1 and 2
* Ctrip ($C$) allows managerial response in period 2, eLong ($E$) does not
* $\bar{y}_{i,j}$ = average number of reviews on platform $i$ in period $j$

**Difference in Differences**:

* Difference in average volume between 2 periods across different platforms:

$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{\beta}_{DiD} =  (\bar{y}_{C,2} - \bar{y}_{C,1}) - (\bar{y}_{E,2} - \bar{y}_{E,1})
\end{equation}
$$

* Assumes that hotels that decide to use managerial response on Ctrip are not different to those who don't adopt it
  * "No inherent (managerial) quality difference"
  * If there is, it will make estimates of the treatment effect **biased**

Why are we worrying about this?

* Hotels can self select into whether they adopted Managerial Responses on Ctrip
  * And those that do might be systematically different than non-adopters
  * Self selection is *always* a worry when we want causality

---
# Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences

* Some more notation:
  * Let $A$ denote hotels that adopt managerial responses on Ctrip
  * Let $N$ denote hotels that do not adopt managerial responses on Ctrip

*Note*: We observe reviews of both types of hotels on both platforms!

**Difference-in-Difference-in-Differences**

* Difference in differences of average volumes between 2 periods and each hotel "type" across different platforms

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{\beta}_{DDD} &= [ (\bar{y}_{C,A,2} - \bar{y}_{C,A,1}) - (\bar{y}_{C,N,2} - \bar{y}_{C,N,1})] \\
     &- [ (\bar{y}_{E,A,2} - \bar{y}_{E,A,1}) - (\bar{y}_{E,N,2} - \bar{y}_{E,N,1})]
\end{align}
$$

We've "subtracted out" the differences in managerial quality

---
# Regression Equation

How do the authors do that as a regression?

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta Y_{it} = 
   \gamma MR_i +
   \beta MR_{i} \times After_{it} + 
   \delta ' X_{it} + 
   \alpha_i + 
   \theta_t +
   \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
$$

* $\beta$ is the treatment effect $\implies$ this is the (only) number we care about

The 'extra' difference is in the use of $\Delta Y_{it}$ rather than $Y_{it}$

  * Not a 'totally standard' way of doing it, but it works

# Main Results - Impact on Volume, not Valence

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/mr_main_result.png")
```

Interpretation:

* Specification (3) and (6) are the richest
* On average, 12.3% increase in monthly volume after adopting managerial responses 

---
# Target & Style of Managerial Response


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/mr_length_result.png")
```

Main Takeaways:

* Short Responses to Positive Reviews to not distract consumers
* Longer Responses to Negative Reviews to mitigate concerns
